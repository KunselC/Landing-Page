								<h2>Who am I?</h2>
								<p>Hi, I'm Kunsel, a high school student with a ton of dreams and just as many plans. One of the greatest moments for me are those "Oh, THAT'S how it works" realizations.
									That doesn't mean I won't keep asking questions, and I'll be improving from there!
								</p>
								<p>I got into computers at the start of my freshman year of high school and haven't stopped pursuing it since then. I attended workshops at UC Berkeley and took CIS 
									college classes while still in high school before being accepted into Google's Code Next program, which connects high school students to a community of fellow
									high school STEM enthusiasts and Google employees specializing in everything from products to software. Now, I'm a software engineer fellow at Headstarter AI, 
									the #1 community for sofware engineers. I'm learning by doing, building real projects (like this one) to showcase my talents. Check out my LinkedIn for updates!

								<h2>Why me?</h2>
								<p>I'm driven by an interest in producing tangible change in the world. What separates me from other software engineers is my age. Hear me out. One concern you might 
									have is that I'm younger and therefore have less overall experience. I've done my due dilligence with the older technologies, like your standared web development 
									tech stacks and data query languages like SQL. What's different about me is I have much more experience with new advances and updates than many currently employed 
									SWEs. I can effectively and accurately use AI to speed up tasks and get that backlog empty for the first time. :)
